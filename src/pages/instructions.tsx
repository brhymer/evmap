      <p className="mb-4">The tool enables users to:</p>
      <ol className="list-inside mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">a). select which criteria are included in the “priority” and “feasibility” layers (via the settings wheel) and</li>
        <li className="mb-2">b). adjust the intensity of the criteria as appropriate to the local context (via sliders).</li>
      </ol>
      <p className="mb-4">These selections and adjustments will yield unique combinations of pixels using “AND” logic - i.e., only pixels that meet all selected criteria will remain on the map. Areas with high concentrations or overlap of both “priority” and “feasibility” pixels are likely candidate zones for investment.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">For example:</p>
      <ol className="list-inside mb-4">
        <li className="mb-4">
        <span className="font-bold">CalEnviroScreen4.0 percentile:</span>
        <br /> Slide to define the range of CalEnviroScreen percentile scores included in the "priority" pixel set. A higher range (e.g., 70-100) will limit the set to show only those areas scoring highest across the CES4.0 environmental vulnerability indicators.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <span className="font-bold">L2 chargers within 10 min walk:</span>
          <br /> Slide the range down to exclude pixels with multiple existing Level 2 chargers available within a 10 minute walk of the pixel.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <span className="font-bold">PG&E load capacity:</span>
          <br /> Increase the bottom slider to exclude areas with electrical distribution grid capacity (in kW) lower than the indicated number.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <span className="font-bold">NEVI and IRS 30C eligible:</span>
          <br /> Toggle on to show areas eligible for either funding source; toggle both on to show areas eligible for both.
        </li>
      </ol>
